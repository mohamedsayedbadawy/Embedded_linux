# Embedded Linux Manual Customization Guide

This repository contains files for the manual customization of an **Embedded Linux** system, including the toolchain, bootloader, kernel, and root filesystem.

## Repository Structure


### 1. **Root file system/RootFile system**
   - This folder contains files and instructions for manually setting up the **root filesystem** for the embedded Linux system.
   - It includes configuration files, scripts, and guidelines on manually adding packages, libraries, and dependencies to create a working root filesystem.

### 2. **bootloader_customization/Bootloader**
   - This folder includes customization and configuration of the **U-Boot bootloader**.
   - Inside, you'll find necessary configuration files for U-Boot, along with a step-by-step guide for manually compiling and flashing it onto the embedded system.

### 3. **linux_kernel/Kernel customization**
   - This folder provides the manual configuration and customization of the **Linux kernel**.
   - It contains `.config` files for the kernel, kernel patches, and instructions on manually compiling the kernel for the specific target architecture.

### 4. **toolchain**
   - This folder provides information on setting up a **cross-compilation toolchain** manually.
   - Instructions are included to install and configure the toolchain needed to compile the bootloader, kernel, and root filesystem for the embedded hardware.

### 5. **RootFileSystem.zip**
   - A zipped version of the `Root file system/` folder.
   - It contains the same files as the uncompressed folder, intended for easier sharing or distribution.

### 6. **bootloader_customization.zip**
   - A zipped version of the `bootloader_customization/` folder, containing the same files for manual U-Boot customization and compilation.

### 7. **linux_kernel.zip**
   - A zipped version of the `linux_kernel/` folder, containing the same kernel customization files for easy transfer.
