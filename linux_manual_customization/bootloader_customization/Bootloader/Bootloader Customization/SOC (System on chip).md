- ### Difference Between (General purpose controller  ---> PC  )&& SOC &&( specific Micro controller )
     - #### general purpose (PC)
         - ##### CPU 
         - ####   a large number of peripherals 
        - ####   it does many functions
    - ### SOC (for certain industry  )
        - #### CPU
        - #### And large number of peripherals but less than PC 
        - #### variance in usage 
    - ### Single Usage 
         - #### CPU 
         - #### number of peripherals 
         - #### but it's used for certain usage 
- ## Board  
     - #### Board --->(SOC +Extension)
         - #### extensions like (USB - Ethernet - external memory - HDMI + ....... etc )
    - #### SOC --->( Architecture(CPU)+ peripherals )
        - #### so will find many Boards  have same  SOC but different  extension ex: raspi3 and raspi4
